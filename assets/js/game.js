ask player if they want to play again
if yes call startGame()

After the player skips/defeats the enemy with more fights to go
ask the player if they want to shop
If no, continue as normal
If yes, call the shop() function

In the shop() function, ask player if they want to "refill" health, "upgrade" attack, or "leave" the shop
If refill, subtract money points from player and increase health
If upgrade, subtract money points from player and increase attack power
If leave, alert goodbye and exit the function
If any other invalid option, call shop() again
